ldesc: "DBH (acronym for Disk Based Hashtable) is a convenient way to
associate unsigned character keys to data records. Any kind of digital
information can go into the data record, such as text, graphic information,
database structures, you name it. The idea behind using a DBH is build the key
index directly into a multidimensional file format."

libodb
------------------------------------------
ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides tools,
APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects to a
relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables, columns, or
SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the common ODB runtime library. Every application that
includes code generated by the ODB compiler will need to link to this library.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.25-1
  libgcc1-4.7.3-1
  libodb-devel-2.2.3-1bl1
  libodb2.2-2.2.3-1bl1
  libstdc++6-4.7.3-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-9-1
  binutils-2.23.51-1
  cygport-0.14.0-1
  gcc-core-4.7.3-1
  gcc-g++-4.7.3-1
  libtool-2.4-1
  make-4.0-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack libodb-2.2.3-X-src.tar.xz
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
        unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./libodb-2.2.3-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libodb-2.2.3-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libodb-2.2.3-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libodb2.2-2.2.3-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libodb-devel-2.2.3-X.tar.xz

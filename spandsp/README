spandsp
------------------------------------------
Spandsp is a library of many DSP functions for telephony. These range from
simple modules, such as DTMF detection, to a complete software FAX machine.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.16-1
  libgcc1-4.5.3-3
  libtiff-devel-3.9.6-1
  libtiff5-3.9.6-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-10-1
  automake-7-1
  binutils-2.22.51-2
  cygport-0.11.0-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libspandsp2-0.0.6pre21-X.tar.bz2

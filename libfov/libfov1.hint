ldesc: "libfov is a C library for calculating fields of view and lighting on
low resolution rasters, suitable for roguelike games. In that screenshot
below, imagine that green dot is your character in a computer game, and as you
walk around (move between tiles on the grid), you want to know which tiles you
can see and which tiles you cannot. libfov calculates exactly that."

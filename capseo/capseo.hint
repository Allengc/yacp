ldesc: "Capseo is a realtime video codec being used by libcaptury/captury for
encoding captured video frames in realtime. (think of FRAPS codec).
Applications using capseo currently are libcaptury for encoding captured data,
e.g. currently from third-party OpenGL applications via captury, the OpenGL
video capturing tool (think of FRAPS tool, again ? but for GNU/Linux)."

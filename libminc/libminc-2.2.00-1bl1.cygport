SUMMARY="Core library and API of the MINC toolkit"
DESCRIPTION="The MINC file format is a highly flexible medical image file format built on
the HDF5 generalized data format. The format is simple, self-describing,
extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with programming interfaces for both
low-level data access and high-level volume manipulation. On top of the
libraries is a suite of generic image-file manipulation tools. The format,
libraries and tools are designed for use in a medical-imaging research
environment : they are simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a
pretty interface to users."

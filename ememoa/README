------------------------------------------
Memory pool allocator that help to improve memory allocation speed and memory
usage by improving memory locality during data manipulation. To do so it
require a little bit more help from the developper to tell him what kind of
usage pattern the allocator must expect.

It also include a static buffer allocator, thus avoiding any further syscall,
but in that case the maximum available memory will only be 64MBytes.

To help the developper in optimizing and providing this information, it
provide some pretty good statistic so that developers can learn a bit more how
the application consume and use in real world the allocated data.

It also include, in debug mode, a lot of assertion and memory verification
which stop as soon as detected the program. This will also help the developper
by reducing the time between a memory corruption and it's detection.

The current SVN version is considered stable and optimized. The TODO is almost
complete, but if you want another feature don't hesitate to ask it !

Build instructions:
  unpack ememoa-0.0.27+svn42-X-src.tar.xz
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
        unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./ememoa-0.0.27+svn42-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ememoa-0.0.27+svn42-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/ememoa-0.0.27+svn42-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libememoa0-0.0.27+svn42-X.tar.xz

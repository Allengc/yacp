ldesc: "ImageWorsener is a cross-platform command-line utility and library for
image scaling and other image processing. It has full support for PNG, JPEG,
BMP formats, experimental support for WebP, read-only support for GIF, and
limited support for some other image formats. It's not as fast or
memory-efficient as some utilities, but it's very accurate."

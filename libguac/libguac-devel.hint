ldesc: "Guacamole is an HTML5 web application that provides access to desktop
environments using remote desktop protocols such as VNC or RDP. A centralized
server acts as a tunnel and proxy, allowing access to multiple desktops
through a web browser. No plugins are needed: the client requires nothing more
than a web browser supporting HTML5 and AJAX."

ldesc: "The PreludeDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and
the format of the database used to store IDMEF alerts. It allows developers to
use the Prelude IDMEF database easily and efficiently without worrying about
SQL, and to access the database independently of the type/format of the
database."

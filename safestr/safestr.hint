sdesc: "Safe C String Library (licensing & readmes)"
ldesc: "The goal of the SafeStr library is to provide a rich string-handling
library for C that has safe semantics yet interoperates with legacy library
code in a straightforward manner. Additionally, porting code that uses
standard C string handling should be straightforward. The library should work
on all modern Unix-like platforms, as well as any 32-bit Microsoft Windows OS."

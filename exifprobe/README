exifprobe
------------------------------------------
Exifprobe reads image files produced by digital cameras (including
several so-called raw file formats) and reports the structure of
the files and the auxilliary data and metadata contained within them.
In addition to TIFF, JPEG, and EXIF, the program understands several
formats which may contain raw camera data, including MRW, CIFF/CRW,
JP2/JPEG2000, RAF, and X3F, as well as most most TIFF-derived raw
formats, including DNG, ORF, CR2, NEF, K25/KDC/DCR, and PEF.

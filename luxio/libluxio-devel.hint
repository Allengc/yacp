sdesc: "Yet another fast database manager (development)"
ldesc: "Lux IO is a yet another fast database manager. It supports B+-tree and
Array index in either cluster or non-cluster index.
It's originally designed for storing large expanding data as a value in Lux
Search Engine, but it's also pretty fast for small and a large number of data."

------------------------------------------
SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays.

SnapRAID stores redundancy information in the disk array, and it allows
recovering from up to two disk failures.

SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, where you have a lot of
big files that rarely change.

Beside the ability to recover from disk failures, the other features of
SnapRAID are:
 * You can start using SnapRAID with already filled disks.
 * The disks of the array can have different sizes.
 * You can add disks at any time.
 * If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can recover them.
 * If more than two disks fail, you lose the data only on the failed disks.
   All the data in the other disks is safe.
 * It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any time
   without the need to reformat or move data.
 * All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and to avoid silent
   corruption.

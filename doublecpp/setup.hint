sdesc: "Preprocessor for double dispatch in C++"
ldesc: "Doublecpp is a preprocessor for C++ that handles a new linguistic
construct for defining branches of a multi-method. The 'right' branch of such a
method will be selected dynamically at run-time according to the actual type of
the object on which the method is invoked and to the actual type of the first
argument: double dispatch."

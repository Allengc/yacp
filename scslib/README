scslib
------------------------------------------
Software Carry-Save (SCS) Library, a fast and lightweight multiple-precision
library.

SCSLib has the following features:

 * Multiple-precision
SCSLib is a fixed-precision library, where precision is selected at
compile-time. Out-of-the-box, the library ensures 210 bits of precision
(quad-double). It is easily configurable to do twice or half, and with a
little bit more work it can in principle ensure up to a few thousand bits.

 * Floating-point format
The SCS format is a floating-point format where exponents are machine integers
(usually 32-bit numbers), which ensures a huge exponent range.

 * Supported operations
SCSLib currently offers addition/subtraction, multiplication, and an
experimental division, plus all the useful conversion functions.

 * IEEE-754 compatibility
The range of SCS numbers includes the range of IEEE double-precision numbers,
including denormals and exceptional cases. Conversions between SCS format and
IEEE-754 doubles, as well as arithmetic operations, follow the IEEE rules
concerning the exceptional cases. SCS doesn't ensure correct rounding, but
provides conversions to doubles in the four IEEE-754 rounding modes.

 * Performance
SCSLib is designed to be fast. With 210 bits, it outperforms MPF for most
operations on most architectures.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack scslib-1.4.1-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./scslib-1.4.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/scslib-1.4.1-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/scslib-1.4.1-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libscs0-1.4.1-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libscs-devel-1.4.1-X.tar.bz2

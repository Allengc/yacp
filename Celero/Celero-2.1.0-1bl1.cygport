SUMMARY="C++ Benchmark Authoring Library/Framework"
DESCRIPTION="Developing consistent and meaningful benchmark results for code is a complex
task. Measurement tools exist (Intel VTune Amplifier, SmartBear AQTime,
Valgrind) external to applications, but they are sometimes expensive for small
teams or cumbersome to utilize. This project, Celero, aims to be a small
library which can be added to a C++ project and perform benchmarks on code in
a way which is easy to reproduce, share, and compare among individual runs,
developers, or projects. Celero uses a framework similar to that of GoogleTest
to make its API easier to use and integrate into a project. Make automated
benchmarking as much a part of your development process as automated testing.

Celero uses CMake to provide cross-platform builds. It does require a modern
compiler (Visual C++ 2012 or GCC 4.7+) due to its use of C++11.

Once Celero is added to your project. You can create dedicated benchmark
projects and source files. For convenience, there is single header file and a
CELERO_MAIN macro that can be used to provide a main() for your benchmark
project that will automatically execute all of your benchmark tests."

mcpp
------------------------------------------
mcpp is a C/C++ preprocessor with the following features.

    * Implements all of C90, C99 and C++98 specifications.
    * Provides a validation suite to test C/C++ preprocessor's conformance and
      quality comprehensively. When this validation suite is applied, mcpp
      distinguishes itself among many existing preprocessors.
    * Has plentiful and on-target diagnostics to check all the preprocessing
      problems such as latent bug or lack of portability in source code.
    * Has #pragma directives to output debugging information.
    * Is portable and has been ported to many compiler-systems, including GCC
      and Visual C++, on UNIX-like systems and Windows.
    * Has various behavior modes.
    * Can be built either as a compiler-specific preprocessor to replace the
      resident preprocessor of a particular compiler system, or as a
      compiler-independent command, or even as a subroutine called from some
      other main program.
    * Provides comprehensive documents both in Japanese and in English.
    * Is an open source software released under BSD-style-license.

Build instructions:
  unpack mcpp-2.7.2-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./mcpp-2.7.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/mcpp-2.7.2-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/mcpp-2.7.2-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libmcpp0-2.7.2-X.tar.bz2

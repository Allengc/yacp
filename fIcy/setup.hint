ldesc: "fIcy is a small icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite for use under
shell environment. Its goal is to automatically rip a stream into user
customisable files. It will work with ICY compatible streams, allowing you to
either to save the stream to disk or to pipe the output to a media player, or
even both. fIcy, among other uses, is ideal for batch/unattended recording of
radio programs and stream debugging."

SUMMARY="Encoding detector library ported from Mozilla"
DESCRIPTION="uchardet is an encoding detector library, which takes a sequence of bytes in
an unknown character encoding without any additional information, and attempts
to determine the encoding of the text. Returned encoding names are
iconv-compatible.

uchardet started as a C language binding of the original C++ implementation of
the universal charset detection library by Mozilla. It can now detect more
charsets, and more reliably than the original implementation."

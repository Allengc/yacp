msgpack
------------------------------------------
MessagePack is a binary-based efficient object serialization library. It
enables to exchange structured objects between many languages like JSON. But
unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.35-1
  libmsgpack-devel-1.0.0-1bl1
  libmsgpack4-1.0.0-1bl1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-9-1
  binutils-2.25-1
  cmake-3.1.2-1
  cygport-0.18.1-1
  gcc-core-4.9.2-3
  gcc-g++-4.9.2-3
  libtool-2.4.6-1
  make-4.1-1

Canonical download:

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack msgpack-1.0.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./msgpack-1.0.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/msgpack-1.0.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/msgpack-1.0.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libmsgpack4-1.0.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libmsgpack-devel-1.0.0-X.tar.xz

airsched
------------------------------------------
airsched aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as a C++
library, of an Airline Schedule Management System. It is intended to be used
in simulated environments only: it is not designed to work in the real-world
of Airline IT operations.

airsched makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the Boost (C++
Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

Install the airsched package if you need a library of basic C++ objects for
Airline Schedule Management, mainly for simulation purpose.

Runtime requirements:
  bash-4.1.10-4
  cygwin-1.7.17-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack airsched-1.00.0-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./airsched-1.00.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/airsched-1.00.0-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/airsched-1.00.0-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libairsched1.00-1.00.0-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libairsched-devel-1.00.0-X.tar.bz2

sdesc: "Supersonic Query Engine (licensing & readmes)"
ldesc: "Supersonic is an ultra-fast, column oriented query engine library
written in C++. It provides a set of data transformation primitives which make
heavy use of cache-aware algorithms, SIMD instructions and vectorised
execution, allowing it to exploit the capabilities and resources of modern,
hyper pipelined CPUs. It is designed to work in a single process."

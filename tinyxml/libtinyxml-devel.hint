ldesc: "TinyXML is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily
integrating into other programs.

I found myself writing a text file parser every time I needed to save human
readable data or serialize objects; I created TinyXML to solve the text I/O
file once and for all. (Or, as a friend said, end the Just Another Text File
Parser problem.)"

clamz
------------------------------------------
Clamz is a little command-line program to download MP3 files from Amazon.com's
music store. It is intended to serve as a substitute for Amazon's official MP3
Downloader, which is not free software (and therefore is only available in
binary form for a limited set of platforms.) Clamz can be used to download
either individual songs or complete albums that you have purchased from
Amazon.

Please keep in mind that there is absolutely no warranty of any kind. Use this
software at your own risk.

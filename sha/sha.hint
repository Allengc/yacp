ldesc: "sha is a simple program that hashes files. It uses the National
Institute of Standards and Technology's Secure Hash Algorithm. It can use
SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, which generate respectively, hashes of
160, 256, 384, or 512 bits. sha can be used in scripts to do, for example,
file integrity checking. The C implementations of the algorithms might be
useful in other projects as well."

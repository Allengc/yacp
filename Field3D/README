Field3D
------------------------------------------
Field3D is an open source library for storing voxel data. It provides C++
classes that handle in-memory storage and a file format based on HDF5 that
allows the C++ objects to be written to and read from disk.

The library and file format is both flexible and extendable. The flexibility
comes from supporting heterogeneous storage of data structures, bit depths,
transformations/mappings and metadata in a single file. When functionality
needs to be extended, the plugin and class factory architecture allows new
data structures, mappings and file I/O routines to be added.

Field3D was developed with the needs and scale of visual effects production in
mind. Dense and MAC-fields handle the basic tasks in fluid simulation and
volume rendering, and where memory becomes a limiting factor optimization of
used/unused space is provided by the sparse fields, which include an
out-of-core/dynamic loading mechanism. Procedural fields are also supported,
which may be used interchangeably with voxel-based fields.

The code was initially developed at Sony Pictures Imageworks as a replacement
for the three different in-house file formats previously used to store voxel
data. It is currently used in several contexts: both our volume rendering and
fluid simulation frameworks use it as their native data structures and file
format, and in Houdini it serves as the base for our voxel and levelset
editing toolsets.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack Field3D-1.6.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./Field3D-1.6.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/Field3D-1.6.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/Field3D-1.6.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libField3D1.6-1.6.1-X.tar.xz

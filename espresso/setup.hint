ldesc: "ESPResSo is a highly versatile software package for performing and
analyzing scientific Molecular Dynamics many-particle simulations of
coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring models as they are used in soft-matter
research in physics, chemistry and molecular biology. It can be used to
simulate systems such as polymers, liquid crystals, colloids, ferrofluids and
biological systems, for example DNA and lipid membranes."

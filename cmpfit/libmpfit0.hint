sdesc: "MINPACK-1 Least Squares Fitting Library in C (runtime)"
ldesc: "MPFIT uses the Levenberg-Marquardt technique to solve the
least-squares problem. In its typical use, MPFIT will be used to fit a
user-supplied function (the 'model') to user-supplied data points (the
'data') by adjusting a set of parameters. MPFIT is based upon MINPACK-1
(LMDIF.F) by More' and collaborators."

ldesc: "Hesiod is a system which uses existing DNS functionality to provide
access to databases of information that changes infrequently.  It is often
used to distribute information kept in the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and
/etc/printcap files, among others.  The hesinfo package contains the hesinfo
client program, which can be used to query Hesiod."

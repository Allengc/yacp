httperf
------------------------------------------
Httperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It provides a flexible
facility for generating various HTTP workloads and for measuring server
performance.

The focus of httperf is not on implementing one particular benchmark but on
providing a robust, high-performance tool that facilitates the construction of
both micro- and macro-level benchmarks. The three distinguishing
characteristics of httperf are its robustness, which includes the ability to
generate and sustain server overload, support for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL
protocols, and its extensibility to new workload generators and performance
measurements.

Runtime requirements:

Build instructions:
  unpack httperf-0.9.1+svn140-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./httperf-0.9.1+svn140-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/httperf-0.9.1+svn140-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/httperf-0.9.1+svn140-X.tar.bz2

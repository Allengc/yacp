xmlfy
------------------------------------------
The xmlfy command is a powerful yet lightweight tool that primarily caters for
converting ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 based output into XML format on the
fly and dealing with common issues associated with this kind of
transformation. xmlfy can be invoked from the command line or from within a
shell script to transform data quickly, easily and reliably.

xmlfy provides many features and options to capture and encapsulate data
between XML tags for both simple and complex XML tree hierarchies. The
behavior of xmlfy is controlled by arguments and/or by specifying a schema
file providing high levels of flexibility and customization for differing
input scenarios.

With the increasing presence of object-oriented systems requiring well
structured data presentation, xmlfy allows you to convert your raw data into
XML format easily which can then be used as input for modern object-oriented
systems e.g. XML style sheets (XSLT).

  1. unpack xmlfy-1.5.5-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./xmlfy-1.5.5-X.cygport all

ldesc: "libebb is a lightweight HTTP server library for C. It lays the
foundation for writing a web server by providing the socket juggling and
request parsing. By implementing the HTTP/1.1 grammar provided in RFC2612,
libebb understands most most valid HTTP/1.1 connections (persistent,
pipelined, and chunked requests included) and rejects invalid or malicious
requests. libebb supports SSL over HTTP."

Build instructions:
  1. unpack solarus-1.4.5-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./solarus-1.4.5-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/solarus-1.4.5-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/solarus-1.4.5-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libsolarus0-1.4.5-X.tar.xz

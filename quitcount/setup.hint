sdesc: "Simple counter for people who quit smoking"
ldesc: "QuitCount is a simple counter that shows what you spared since you
quit smoking. Once you tell it the date you quit, how much you smoked, and how
much it cost, it'll tell you how many cigarettes you didn't smoke since, and
how much it makes in terms of money, tar, and life expectancy."

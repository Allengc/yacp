sdesc: "Widget toolkit using Clutter (runtime/gtk)"
ldesc: "Mx is a clutter widget toolkit that provides a set of standard user
interface elements, including buttons, progress bars, tooltips, scroll bars
and others. It also implements some standard layout managers. One other
interesting feature is the possibility of setting style properties from a
css-like file. It is currently used by Moblin to provide the user experience."

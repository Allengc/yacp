SUMMARY="C++ library offering some basic functionality for platform-independent programs"
DESCRIPTION="libfilezilla is a small and modern C++ library, offering some basic
functionality to build high-performing, platform-independent programs. Some of
the highlights include:
 * A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet
   extremely efficient
 * Timers for periodic events
 * A datetime class that not only tracks timestamp but also their accuracy,
   which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources
 * Simple process handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O"

sdesc: "Multi-word Bitmask Library (development)"
ldesc: "This Bitmask library supports multi-word bitmask operations for
applications programmed in 'C'. It works in conjunction with recent Linux
kernel support for processor and memory placement on multiprocessor SMP and
NUMA systems. The cpuset library, being developed in parallel, depends on this
bitmask library."

ldesc: "This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a
satisfiability algorithm.

This code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

  1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
     and dependency information.

  2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
     resolving package dependencies."

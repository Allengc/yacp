CATEGORY="Libs"
SUMMARY="Library for solving packages and reading repositories"
DESCRIPTION="This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfiability
algorithm.

This code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

 1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package and dependency
    information.

 2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for resolving
    package dependencies."

ucpp
------------------------------------------
A C preprocessor is a part of a C compiler responsible for macro replacement,
conditional compilation and inclusion of header files. It is often found as a
stand-alone program on Unix systems.

ucpp is such a preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light, but anyway
fully compliant to the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known as C99. ucpp can be
compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some other code; in the latter
case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a time, on demand, as an integrated
lexer.

ucpp operates in two modes: -- lexer mode: ucpp is linked to some other code
and outputs a stream of tokens (each call to the lex() function will yield one
token) -- non-lexer mode: ucpp preprocesses text and outputs the resulting text
to a file descriptor; if linked to some other code, the cpp() function must be
called repeatedly, otherwise ucpp is a stand-alone binary.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack ucpp-1.3.4-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./ucpp-1.3.4-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ucpp-1.3.4-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/ucpp-1.3.4-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libucpp13-1.3.4-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libucpp-devel-1.3.4-X.tar.xz

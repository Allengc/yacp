ucpp
------------------------------------------
A C preprocessor is a part of a C compiler responsible for macro replacement,
conditional compilation and inclusion of header files. It is often found as a
stand-alone program on Unix systems.

ucpp is such a preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light, but anyway
fully compliant to the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known as C99. ucpp can be
compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some other code; in the latter
case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a time, on demand, as an integrated
lexer.

ucpp operates in two modes: -- lexer mode: ucpp is linked to some other code
and outputs a stream of tokens (each call to the lex() function will yield one
token) -- non-lexer mode: ucpp preprocesses text and outputs the resulting
text to a file descriptor; if linked to some other code, the cpp() function
must be called repeatedly, otherwise ucpp is a stand-alone binary.

Build instructions:
  unpack ucpp-1.3.2-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./ucpp-1.3.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ucpp-1.3.2-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/ucpp-1.3.2-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libucpp0-1.3.2-X.tar.bz2

sdesc: "Monitor one or more log files"
ldesc: "This program will monitor one or more log files, updating when more
data is available a la 'tail -f' , within a common terminal window via a
'split window'. User can scroll up/down/left/right through all the windows. A
header displays each frames file name, and number of lines in the file. Very
useful when watching several log files at the same time."

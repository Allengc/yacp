ldesc: "liburcu is a LGPLv2.1 userspace RCU (read-copy-update) library. This
data synchronization library provides read-side access which scales linearly
with the number of cores. It does so by allowing multiples copies of a given
data structure to live at the same time, and by monitoring the data structure
accesses to detect grace periods after which memory reclamation is possible."

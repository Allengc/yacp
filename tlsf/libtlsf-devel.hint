sdesc: "Two Level Segregated Fit memory allocator (development)"
ldesc: "TLSF (two level segregated fit) is a relatively new memory
allocator designed for embedded systems. It boasts constant
time O(1) malloc/free response time and a 4-byte block
overhead. Though it typically is slightly slower than other
allocators such as dlmalloc, it has no worst-case behavior."

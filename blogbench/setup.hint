ldesc: "Blogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce
the load of a real-world busy file server.

It stresses the filesystem with multiple threads performing random reads,
writes and rewrites in order to get a realistic idea of the scalability and
the concurrency a system can handle."

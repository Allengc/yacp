SUMMARY="Disjunctive Normal Form boolean expression library"
DESCRIPTION="BoolStuff is a C++ library that supports a few operations on boolean
expression binary trees. The main features are:

 * a simple boolean expression parser (supports operators AND, OR and NOT, as
   well as parentheses);
 * an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into its
   Disjunctive Normal Form (this algorithm supports the NOT operator);
 * a function that determines if an expression tree is in DNF.

A command named booldnf that calls this library to convert an expression to
the DNF is also provided."

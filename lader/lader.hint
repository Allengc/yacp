ldesc: "lader is a program that is able to train and use discriminative
parsers to improve machine translation reordering. It is unlike other parsers
in that it can be trained directly from aligned parallel text with no
annotated syntax trees. Using it for translation between language pairs with
very different word order can greatly improve translation accuracy."

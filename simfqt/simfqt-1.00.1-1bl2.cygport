SUMMARY="C++ Simulation Fare Quote Library"
DESCRIPTION="SimFQT aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as a C++
library, of a Travel-oriented fare engine. It corresponds to the simulated
version of the real-world Fare Quote or pricing system.

SimFQT makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for increased
functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the Boost (C++ Standard
Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

SimFQT is the one of the components of the Travel Market Simulator
(http://www.travel-market-simulator). However, it may be used in a stand-alone
mode."

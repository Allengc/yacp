skipfish
------------------------------------------
Skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It
prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a
recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then
annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully
non-disruptive) security checks. The final report generated by the tool is
meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security
assessments.

Key features:

 * High speed: pure C code, highly optimized HTTP handling, minimal CPU
   footprint - easily achieving 2000 requests per second with responsive
   targets.
 * Ease of use: heuristics to support a variety of quirky web frameworks and
   mixed-technology sites, with automatic learning capabilities, on-the-fly
   wordlist creation, and form autocompletion.
 * Cutting-edge security logic: high quality, low false positive, differential
   security checks, capable of spotting a range of subtle flaws, including
   blind injection vectors.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack skipfish-2.10b-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./skipfish-2.10b-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/skipfish-2.10b-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/skipfish-2.10b-X.tar.xz

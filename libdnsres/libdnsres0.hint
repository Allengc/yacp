ldesc: "Libdnsres provides a non-blocking thread-safe API for resolving DNS
names. It requires that your main application is built on top of libevent.
Libdnsres' API essentially mirrors the traditional gethostbyname and
getaddrinfo interfaces. All return values have been replaced by callbacks
instead."

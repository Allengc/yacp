ldesc: "Filter Chains Processor (FCP) is a command line utility that handles
multiple files transformations, automatically building filter chains in order
to transform each input file from its format to the desired output format.

Each filter chain is computed dinamically, using external tools (defined by
the user in a configuration file)."

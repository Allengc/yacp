libpwquality
------------------------------------------
The libpwquality library purpose is to provide common functions for password
quality checking and also scoring them based on their apparent randomness. The
library also provides a function for generating random passwords with good
pronounceability. The library supports reading and parsing of a configuration
file.

In the package there are also very simple utilities that use the library
function and PAM module that can be used instead of pam_cracklib. The module
supports all the options of pam_cracklib.

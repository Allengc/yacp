sdesc: "Library for passing menus over DBus (runtime/gtk3)"
ldesc: "A small little library that was created by pulling out some comon code
out of indicator-applet. It passes a menu structure across DBus so that a
program can create a menu simply without worrying about how it is displayed on
the other side of the bus."

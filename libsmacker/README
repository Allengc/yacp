libsmacker
------------------------------------------
libsmacker is a cross-platform C library which can be used for decoding
Smacker Video files produced by RAD Game Tools. Smacker Video was the king of
video middleware in the 1990s, and its 256-color compressed video format was
used in over 2600 software titles.

Smacker files tend to pose a problem for engine rewrite projects for legacy
games: many used the .smk format for intro videos, cutscenes, and animated
textures. Yet the only other open-source solution for playback of .SMK files
involves linking against the whole of ffmpeg (or, at least, libavcodec). Many
projects offer a workaround of re-encoding video to some other modernized
format.

  unpack libsmacker-1.0-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
         unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./libsmacker-1.0-X.cygport all

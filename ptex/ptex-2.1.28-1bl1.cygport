SUMMARY="Per-Face Texture Mapping for Production Rendering"
DESCRIPTION="Ptex is a texture mapping system developed by Walt Disney Animation Studios
for production-quality rendering:

 * No UV assignment is required! Ptex applies a separate texture to each face
   of a subdivision or polygon mesh.
 * The Ptex file format can efficiently store hundreds of thousands of texture
   images in a single file.
 * The Ptex API provides cached file I/O and high-quality filtering -
   everything that is needed to easily add Ptex support to a
   production-quality renderer or texture authoring application."

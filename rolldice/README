rolldice
------------------------------------------
rolldice is just a simple program that rolls an amount of virtual dice of
any size.  Well, technically, all the attributes of the dice can't exceed
SHRT_MAX, but I think it suffices for any normal FRPG.

rolldice is a simple program, trying to uphold the UNIX philosophy of doing
one thing, and doing that thing well.  However, this is not a claim that
rolldice cannot be improved,  only that I am satisfied with it, as of right
now... of course, any improvements will be accepted gladly!

Build instructions:
  1. unpack rolldice-1.15-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./rolldice-1.15-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/rolldice-1.15-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/rolldice-1.15-X.tar.xz

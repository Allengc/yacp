sdesc: "Cool scrolling lines from 'The Matrix'"
ldesc: "CMatrix is a program I wrote one evening because I didn't want to have
to run Wind*ws to see the cool scrolling lines from 'The Matrix', my fave
movie.  If you haven't seen this movie and you are a fan of computers or
sci-fi in general, go see this movie!!!  I have seen it twice, and I'm
pondering seeing it again before it comes out on VHS."

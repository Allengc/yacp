liblogging
------------------------------------------
Liblogging is unique in the way that it was specifically designed for system
logging and ease of use. There are many BEEP libraries out there and most of
them support the syslog reliable RAW profile. However, these libraries have a
very complex API, which is overdone just for logging. Software implementors
stay away from those libraries. We hope that liblogging will make reliable
syslog available to everyone. There is a very short, easy to use and learn
API.

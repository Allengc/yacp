ldesc: "The eot-utils are the two programs mkeot and eotinfo. The former
creates an EOT (Embedded OpenType) file from an OpenType or TrueType
font and the URLs of one or more Web pages. mkeot respects the
TrueType embedding bits. The eotinfo program displays the contents of
an EOT header in a human-readable way."

sdesc: "Vanessa Generic logging layer (app)"
ldesc: "libvanessa_logger is a library that provides a generic logging layer
that may be used to log to one or more of syslog, an open file handle or a file
name. Though due to to limitations in the implementation of syslog opening
multiple syslog loggers doesn't makes sense. Includes the ability to limit
which messages will be logged based on priorities."

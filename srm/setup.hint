ldesc: "srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it
overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This prevents
command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block device. It may
also help frustrate physical examination of the disk, although it's unlikely
that it can completely prevent that type of recovery. It is, essentially, a
paper shredder for sensitive files."

SUMMARY="High performance compressor optimized for binary data"
DESCRIPTION="Blosc is a compression library designed to transmit data to the processor
cache faster than the traditional non-compressed memory fetch.
Compression ratios are not very high, but the decompression is very fast.
Blosc is meant not only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or
in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound computations."

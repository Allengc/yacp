ldesc: "GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation.
Several real machines have been implemented within the framework, consisting
of processors (ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH) and surrounding
hardware components such as framebuffers, interrupt controllers, busses, disk
controllers, and serial controllers. The emulation is working well enough to
allow several unmodified guest operating systems to run."

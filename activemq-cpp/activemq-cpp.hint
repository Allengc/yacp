ldesc: "CMS (stands for C++ Messaging Service) is a JMS-like API for C++ for
interfacing with Message Brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ. CMS helps to make
your C++ client code much neater and easier to follow. To get a better feel

message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ is still needed for your clients to
communicate."

sdesc: "Realtime multimedia capturing framework for currently OpenGL video (runtime)"
ldesc: "Captury is a realtime multimedia capturing framework for currently
OpenGL video (to be extended to XShm and audio/alsa soon). Its uses are e.g.
for capturing video from external OpenGL applications (via captury itself) and
is currently also used by KDE's kwin to record your desktop efficiently
(VideoRecord plugin).

Captury supports full encoding as well as incremential(!) encoding by only
regions from the screen that have actually changed. Window managers
(like kwin) do know of such areas and can make use of it."

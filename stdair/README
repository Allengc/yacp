stdair
------------------------------------------
stdair aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for the basis of Airline IT and travel distribution Business
Object Model (BOM), that is, to be used by several other open source projects,
such as AirRAC, RMOL, AirInv, AvlCal, AirSched, SimFQT, SimLFS, SimCRS,
TravelCCM, SEvMgr, TraDemGen, DSim, OpenTREP, etc.

Install the stdair package if you need a library of basic C++ objects for
Airline IT (e.g., schedule management, inventory, revenue management, revenue
accounting), travel distribution, demand generation and customer choice
modeling, mainly for simulation purpose.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.11-1
  libboost1.48-1.48.0-1
  libgcc1-4.5.3-3
  libsoci_core3.1-3.1.0-1bl1
  libsoci_mysql3.1-3.1.0-1bl1
  libstdc++6-4.5.3-3

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.22.51-2
  cmake-2.8.4-1
  cygport-0.10.10-1
  gcc4-core-4.5.3-3
  gcc4-g++-4.5.3-3

Canonical website:
  http://stdair.sf.net/

Canonical download:
  mirror://sourceforge/stdair/stdair-0.45.1.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack stdair-0.45.1-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./stdair-0.45.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/stdair-0.45.1-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/stdair-0.45.1-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libstdair0.45-0.45.1-X.tar.bz2

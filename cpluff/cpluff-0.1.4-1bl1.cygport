SUMMARY="Plug-in framework for C"
DESCRIPTION="C-Pluff is a plug-in framework for C programs. It has been strongly inspired
by the Java plug-in framework in Eclipse. C-Pluff focuses on providing core
services for plug-in interaction and plug-in management. It aims to be
platform neutral and supports dynamic changes to plug-in configuration without
stopping the whole application or framework. It does not yet provide special
facilities for distribution such as signed plug-in packages or remote plug-in
repositories but it is possible to build such features on top of the current
framework."

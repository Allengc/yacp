SUMMARY="Library that implements RFC 7030 (Enrollment over Secure Transport)"
DESCRIPTION="This project is a library that implements RFC 7030 (Enrollment over Secure
Transport). EST is used to provision certificates from a CA or RA. EST is a
replacement for SCEP, providing several security enhancements and support for
ECC certificates. Libest is written in C and uses OpenSSL 1.0.1. The following
flows defined in RFC 7030 for both server and client operation have been
implemented:

 /getcacerts
 /csrattrs
 /simpleenroll
 /simplereenroll

Also of interest, a EST test server running this library has been setup at
http://testrfc7030.cisco.com/ and can be used for interop testing the EST
protocol."

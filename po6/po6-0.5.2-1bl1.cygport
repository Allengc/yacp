CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="POSIX wrappers for C++"
DESCRIPTION="This is a library that includes all the code I tend to carry from project to
project for wrapping POSIX APIs for C++.  Where possible, things are
implemented inline so that there is minimal to no cost above and beyond using
the good old C APIs."

ldesc: "StLib is library of basic classes for C++. It takes it's name from
words SmallTalk LIBrary where the main inspiration for inheritance hierarchy
and class interfaces was taken. The goal is to provide feature-rich but easy
to use class library. It should also be possible to use it as replacement of
STL library. Well, someday."

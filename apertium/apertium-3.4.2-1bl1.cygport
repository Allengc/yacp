SUMMARY="Free/open-source machine translation platform"
DESCRIPTION="Apertium is a free/open-source machine translation platform, initially aimed
at related-language pairs but expanded to deal with more divergent language
pairs (such as English-Catalan). The platform provides

 * a language-independent machine translation engine
 * tools to manage the linguistic data necessary to build a machine
   translation system for a given language pair and
 * linguistic data for a growing number of language pairs."

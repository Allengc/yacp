ldesc: "A fortran program in which Tirion's model (also called the Elastic
Network Model) is implemented. Within the frame of this model, atoms
(particles) less than cutoff (angstroms) away from each others are linked by
springs of same strength. Alternatively, a list of interacting atoms can be
given to the program."

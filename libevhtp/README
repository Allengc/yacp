libevhtp
------------------------------------------
Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's current HTTP API. The
reality of libevent's http interface is that it was created as a JIT server,
meaning the developer never thought of it being used for creating a
full-fledged HTTP service. Infact I am under the impression that the libevent
http API was designed almost as an example of what you can do with libevent.
It's not Apache in a box, but more and more developers are attempting to use
it as so.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.11-1
  libevent2.0_5-2.0.17-1

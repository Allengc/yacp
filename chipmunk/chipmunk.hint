physics library written in C. Itâ€™s licensed under the unrestrictive, OSI
approved MIT license. My aim is to give 2D developers access to the same
quality of physics you find in newer 3D games. I hope you enjoy using
Chipmunk2D, and please consider donating to help make it worth our time to
continue to support Chipmunk2D with great new features."

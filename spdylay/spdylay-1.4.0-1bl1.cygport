SUMMARY="Experimental SPDY protocol version 2 and 3 implementation in C"
DESCRIPTION="This is an experimental implementation of Google's SPDY protocol in C.

This library provides SPDY version 2, 3 and 3.1 framing layer implementation.
It does not perform any I/O operations. When the library needs them, it calls
the callback functions provided by the application. It also does not include
any event polling mechanism, so the application can freely choose the way of
handling events. This library code does not depend on any particular SSL
library (except for example programs which depend on OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later)."

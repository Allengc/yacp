ldesc: "FreedroidRPG is a mature open source sci-fi isometric role playing
game. It strives at providing an immersive ambience backed by refined graphics
and music tracks. Besides the hack'n'slash action phases, dialogs with dozens
of NPCs take care of storytelling. The player can fight with melee or ranged
weapons, take control of his enemies by hacking, and remotely execute code on
enemy robots."

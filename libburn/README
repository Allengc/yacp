libburn
------------------------------------------
libburn is a library by which preformatted data get onto optical media: CD,
DVD, BD (Blu-Ray). On Linux it uses either /dev/sgN (on kernel 2.4 with
ide-scsi) or /dev/srM , /dev/hdX ( on kernel 2.6). On FreeBSD it uses
/dev/cdN, eventually via atapicam. On Solaris addresses look like
/dev/rdsk/cXtYd0s2.

libburn also offers a facility for reading data blocks from its drives without
using the normal block device i/o, which has its advantages and disadvantages.
It seems appropriate, nevertheless, to do writing and reading via the same
channel. On several Linux systems, the block device driver needs reloading of
the drive tray in order to make available freshly written data. The libburn
read function does not need such a reload.

The code of libburn is independent of cdrecord. Its CD SAO capabilities are
inherited from old libburn. Its CD TAO capabilities are learned from MMC-1.
Its DVD and BD capabilities are learned from studying the code of dvd+rw-tools
and MMC-5 specs. No code but only the pure SCSI knowledge has been taken from
dvd+rw-tools, though.

The underlying knowledge about drive control and media types is collected in
doc/cookbook.txt. But it should by no means be necessary to study this in
order to understand the API and the usage of libburn.

Build instructions:
  unpack libburn-1.2.2-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./libburn-1.2.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libburn-1.2.2-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libburn-1.2.2-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libburn4-1.2.2-X.tar.bz2

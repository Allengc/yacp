ldesc: "C testing framework with support for mock objects. mock objects are
simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in a controlled way.
Instead of calling the real objects, the tested object calls a mock object
that merely asserts that the correct methods were called, with the expected
parameters, in the correct order."

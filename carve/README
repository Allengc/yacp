carve
------------------------------------------
Carve is a C++ library designed to perform boolean operations between two
arbitrary polygonal meshes. The standard union and intersection operations are
supported, as are symmetric and asymmetric difference. It is also possible to
implement custom operations using Carve, allowing results to be formed from
any combination of inputs.

Carve supports a variety of inputs, including both closed and open surfaces,
faces with arbitrary edge counts and datasets with multiple disjoint, embedded
or touching surfaces. Carve can also interpolate arbitrary values across
faces, meaning that CSG operations need not discard colour, texture
coordinates or other data.

Build instructions:
  unpack carve-2.0.0a+hg20120704-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./carve-2.0.0a+hg20120704-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/carve-2.0.0a+hg20120704-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/carve-2.0.0a+hg20120704-X.tar.bz2

SUMMARY="Genomic similarity search with multiple transition constrained spaced seeds"
DESCRIPTION="YASS is a genomic similarity search tool, for nucleic (DNA/RNA) sequences in
fasta or plain text format (it produces local pairwise alignments). This tool
is currently developed and maintained by L. Noe and G. Kucherov of the LIFL
Bioinfo / INRIA Lille-Nord Europe Sequoia group. Like most of the heuristic
DNA local alignment software (BLAST, FASTA, PATTERNHUNTER, BLASTZ ...), YASS
uses seeds to detect potential similarity regions, and then tries to extend
them to actual alignments. This genomic search tool uses multiple transition
constrained spaced seeds that enable to search more fuzzy repeats, as
non-coding DNA/RNA. Another simple, but interesting feature is that you can
specify the seed pattern used in the search step (as provided by hedera or
iedera)."

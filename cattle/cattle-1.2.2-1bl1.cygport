SUMMARY="Toolkit for the Brainfuck programming language"
DESCRIPTION="Cattle is a toolkit for the Brainfuck programming language.

It can be embedded in any application to give it the ability to inspect and
run Brainfuck programs; to make the interaction between the hosting
application and the Brainfuck interpreter completely transparent, Cattle can
be configured to use a custom set of I/O routines instead of the default
ones."

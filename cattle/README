cattle
------------------------------------------
Cattle is a toolkit for the Brainfuck programming language.

It can be embedded in any application to give it the ability to inspect and
run Brainfuck programs; to make the interaction between the hosting
application and the Brainfuck interpreter completely transparent, Cattle can
be configured to use a custom set of I/O routines instead of the default
ones.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-2.4.1-1
  girepository-GLib2.0-1.46.0-1
  libcattle1.0-devel-1.2.0-1bl1
  libcattle1.0_0-1.2.0-1bl1
  libglib2.0-devel-2.46.2-2
  libglib2.0_0-2.46.2-2

Build requirements:

  autoconf-13-1
  automake-9-1
  binutils-2.25-4
  cygport-0.20.2-1
  gcc-core-4.9.3-1
  gobject-introspection-1.46.0-1

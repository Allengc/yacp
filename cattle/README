cattle
------------------------------------------
Cattle is a toolkit for the Brainfuck programming language.

It can be embedded in any application to give it the ability to inspect and
run Brainfuck programs; to make the interaction between the hosting
application and the Brainfuck interpreter completely transparent, Cattle can
be configured to use a custom set of I/O routines instead of the default
ones.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-2.9.0-3
  girepository-GLib2.0-1.52.1-2
  libcattle1.0-devel-1.2.2-1bl1
  libcattle1.0_0-1.2.2-1bl1
  libglib2.0-devel-2.52.3-1
  libglib2.0_0-2.52.3-1
  pkg-config-0.29.1-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-10-1
  binutils-2.29-1
  cygport-0.25.0-1
  gcc-core-6.4.0-4
  gobject-introspection-1.52.1-2

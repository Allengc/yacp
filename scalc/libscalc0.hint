ldesc: "SCalc is a C++ library for manipulation of mathematical expressions.
It is possible to define functions, either using an expression or a C
function. It is able to compute derivatives analytically, and is therefore
suitable for implementing non-linear curve fitting with user-specified
arbitrary functions."

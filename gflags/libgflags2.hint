sdesc: "Commandline flags module for C++ (runtime)"
ldesc: "The gflags package contains a library that implements commandline
flags processing. As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased
flexibility, including built-in support for C++ types like string, and the
ability to define flags in the source file in which they're used."

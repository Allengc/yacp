ldesc: "jj is a simple FIFO and filesystem based Jabber/XMPP client. jj is
inspired by ii IRC client.

jj is more tool than traditional instant messanger client. It can be easily
extended with normal unix tools. It is perfect for bots and notifications.
Interaction with jj is done by writing and reading files from the server
directory which jj creates."

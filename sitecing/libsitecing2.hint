ldesc: "site-C-ing (pronounced 'sightseeing') is a web development environment
akin to HTML::Mason, but it does to c++ what HTML::Mason does to Perl. I used
to use HTML::Mason at some point, but one day I decided that c++ would be more
native environment for me and, besides, that would save me some 50M of RAM on
the server."

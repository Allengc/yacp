ldesc: "ELPH is a general-purpose Gibbs sampler for finding motifs in a set of
DNA or protein sequences. The program takes as input a set containing
anywhere from a few dozen to thousands of sequences, and searches
through them for the most common motif, assuming that each sequence
contains one copy of the motif."

SUMMARY="Lightweight Communications and Marshalling"
DESCRIPTION="LCM is a set of libraries and tools for message passing and data marshalling,
targeted at real-time systems where high-bandwidth and low latency are
critical. It provides a publish/subscribe message passing model and automatic
marshalling/unmarshalling code generation with bindings for applications in a
variety of programming languages. It was originally designed and used by the
MIT DARPA Urban Challenge Team as its message passing system.

LCM is designed for tightly-coupled systems connected via a dedicated
local-area network. It is not intended for message passing over the Internet.
LCM has been developed for soft real-time systems: its default messaging model
permits dropping messages in order to minimize the latency of new messages."
